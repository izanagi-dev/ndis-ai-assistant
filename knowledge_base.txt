NDIS ELIGIBILITY AND OVERVIEW
The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is Australia's way of providing individualised support for people with permanent and significant disability. 
To be eligible for the NDIS, a person must:
- Have a permanent and significant disability that affects their ability to take part in everyday activities.
- Be aged between 7 and 65 (Early Childhood approach is available for those under 7).
- Be an Australian citizen, hold a Permanent Visa, or hold a Protected Special Category Visa.
- Live in Australia.

NDIS PLAN MANAGEMENT TYPES
There are three main ways to manage an NDIS plan's funding:
1. Self-management: The participant manages the funding and pays providers directly. This offers the most flexibility but requires significant record-keeping.
2. Plan-managed: A registered Plan Manager handles the financial tasks, such as paying providers and tracking the budget.
3. NDIA-managed (Agency-managed): The NDIA pays providers directly. Participants can only use NDIS-registered providers under this model.

NDIS SUPPORT CATEGORIES
NDIS funding is generally split into three support budgets:
- Core Supports: Help with everyday activities, consumables, and social participation. This is the most flexible budget.
- Capacity Building: Funding for activities that help a participant build skills and independence, such as therapy, employment support, or life skills training.
- Capital Supports: Funding for one-off expensive items, such as assistive technology (wheelchairs) or home/vehicle modifications.

REASONABLE AND NECESSARY CRITERIA
For a support to be funded by the NDIS, it must meet the 'reasonable and necessary' criteria. This means the support must:
- Be related to the participant's disability.
- Represent value for money.
- Be likely to be effective and beneficial for the participant.
- Not include items that are the responsibility of other government systems (like the health or education system).
